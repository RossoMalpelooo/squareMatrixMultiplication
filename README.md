# squareMatrixMultiplication
Multiplication of 2 matrices(nxn); 3 methods (standard, fork-pipe, threads-mutex) 

This was a project we students were struggling with on the 2nd year exam "Sistemi Operativi" (Operating System) at the Unipr first cycle course "Informatica".

It deals with square matrix multiplication (read from txt files) in the 3 methods mentioned above, and then shows the computation time for each of them. 
This is not the best way to deal with square matrix multiplication, also the code is not indented; this is just the faster way I came out with, due to the project requests.
